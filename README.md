# Study with Sketchnotes

I study with sketchnotes to help me better comprehend and remember what I learned.
Here in this repo I will share with you my sketchnotes on talks, papers, books, and courses I took... 

I wrote a blog post on getting started with visual note-taking: [The Art of Sketchnoting](https://bit.ly/art-of-sketchnoting) and made a short [video](https://youtu.be/Nn0kVMRQAEI) on YouTube as well.
